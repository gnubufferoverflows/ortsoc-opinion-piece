# ortsoc-opinion-piece

This opinion piece is inspired by Jeff's review of the MECOP internship program, which can be found [here](https://github.com/solderq35/mecop-opinion-piece). My goal here is to be a bit more neutral in my review, but I think it is silly to claim that I am unbiased. Because the ORTSOC involves a confidentiality agreement, I will be more sparse on details, and any technical information given here is information that could already be found on the (ORTSOC website)[https://web.archive.org/web/20231030164257/https://ortsoc.oregonstate.edu/students]. This isn't a leak.

There are a few reasons why I am writing here. The first is that SLE reviews are never seen by other students, and Ratemyprofessor reviews can be written by anyone. Although this review is my own personal experience, I have discussed with other people, and while I won't be sharing who, I will incorporate what they have to say in this opinion piece.

## Overview
The ORTSOC claims to be the nation's first cybersecurity teaching hospital. We will evalulate this claim further on. With the current tight job market, students are looking to bypass the previous experience paradox, where companies are unwilling to spend the money to train new graduates on the job. Catering to this concern, the ORTSOC offers students a lucrative deal. This is to say, students can take the course and get nine months of free work experience. ORTSOC students do **not** get paid, however the total combined salaries for the full-time mentors is around $400-500k, plus a few GTA/GRA positions for graduate students. From my understanding, most of the money goes to the administrative overhead of running the ORTSOC. This is using the publicly avaliable salary information. For students, it is work experience to put on their resume. For the ORTSOC, it is dirt cheap labor.

This is mostly aimed towards students who are deciding if they should do this capstone or not. I can't tell you if you should take it or not: this you will have to decide for yourself. The goal here is to give information that will be helpful to someone making the decision. Overall though, I would say the quality of the program is on par with the OSU CS program as a whole. It is not exceptionally good, nor exceptionally bad, when compared to the rest of the EECS department.

I have also heard there are plans to offer a doctorate level degree. Given that the ORTSOC's director doesn't himself have a doctoral degree (his academic experience is as an English major), I am not sure how he plans to make this work. 

## Rotations

ORTSOC is a three quarter capstone program. As you might have imagined, since the program is themed after a teaching hospital, there are clinical rotations. You get assigned to a rotation, and you do that particular rotation for a few weeks. From the ORTSOC website, some of these rotations are:
1. Network Security Monitoring
2. Threat Intelligence
3. Security Engineering
4. Cybersecurity Assessments
5. Threat Hunting
6. Penetration Testing

During this time, you provide SOC services for the clients of the ORTSOC, which the ORTSOC website calls "under-served organizations across the region".

## Environment

The ORTSOC is an in-person SOC. This means that anyone interested in taking the course, to my knowledge, would not be able to work remotely. This is in contrast to other SOC jobs which do allow this form of work. Additionally, if someone has to miss class, the only option is to make up the missing hours, with no option for remote work if sick. The reason for this is likely the same reason many companies are forcing their workers back to the office. It is far easier to stand over someone's shoulder and monitor what they are doing when they are working in-person. 

In terms of work environment, it is strict. Personally, I was sent an email one time for leaving seven minutes early, and I assume time spent packing up was also incorporated into this. I have heard other students have not run into this particular issue, but I can speak only from my own experiences. You also cannot have your phone out, or you will lose points. If you were working on one assigned task and something more urgent came up, and you decided on your own to investigate that new issue, that would be insubordination. From my experience, the communication between mentors and students has not been the best either. Usually, communication is highly indirect, and if you were to do something wrong you wouldn't hear about this until at least a week or two afterwards. Student communication is usually good though. Personally, all of the other students I have worked with have been wonderful.

I think the main paradox of all of this is that they are trying to create an environment of trust in what the ORTSOC considers a zero-trust environment. You can only have one, and not both. In the case of the ORTSOC, distrust prevails. 

## Is it a teaching hospital?

The short answer is probably not. For the ORTSOC to be a teaching hospital, it would need to be providing some sort of real value to its patients. While I can't get into details of specific incidents, most of what happens is security theater. If you are not sure what security theater is, consider your experience going through airport security. Does limiting the amount of liquids you can bring through the scanner offer real security, or is it just made to make people feel secure? This is mostly how the ORTSOC runs. 

Now, if this were the case, why would anyone want to purchase the services of the ORTSOC? Consider the fact that it looks better on a Cybersecurity Insurance policy when the organization has a SOC. Now consider the amount of money saved. Until, of course, there is a major incident, and the insurance company and the client is left wondering what the hell happened. This is just a hypothetical, and I am not referring to any real incident here.

Because of this, I have heard from others who have finished the ORTSOC program that when they go out and do real security operations, they are in for a serious wakeup call.
